# evaluation-test-AI-01

We've designed a small remote technical test to evaluate your general theoretical knowledge and practical know-how regarding the most used algorithms in Machine Learning. You should not spend more than 24 hours on this, so think strategically about what you want to show.

## Project purpose:
Based on the different properties of mushroom, we are going to predict whether a particular species of mushroom is ediable or poisonous. 

## To Do

Before strating check your python version( show us the code that allows you to check your python version)
* Load the dataset from the csv file( To understand more the dataset, let's discover the description of our features and its modalities:
Cap-Shape: bell=b,conical=c,convex=x,flat=f, knobbed=k,sunken=s

Cap-color: brown=n,buff=b,cinnamon=c,gray=g,green=r,pink=p,purple=u,red=e,white=w,yellow=y
Bruises: bruises=t,no=f
Odor: almond=a,anise=l,creosote=c,fishy=y,foul=f,musty=m,none=n,pungent=p,spicy=s
Gill-attachment: attached=a,descending=d,free=f,notched=n
Gill-spacing:close=c,crowded=w,distant=d
Gill-size:broad=b,narrow=n
Gill-color: broad=b,narrow=n
Gill-color: broad=b,narrow=n
Stalk-shape: enlarging=e,tapering=t
Stalk-root: bulbous=b,club=c,cup=u,equal=e,rhizomorphs=z,rooted=r,missing=?
Stalk-surface-above-ring: fibrous=f,scaly=y,silky=k,smooth=s
Stalk-surface-below-ring: fibrous=f,scaly=y,silky=k,smooth=s

Ring-number: none=n,one=o,two=t
Ring-type: cobwebby=c,evanescent=e,flaring=f,large=l,none=n,pendant=p,sheathing=s,zone=z
Spore-print-color: black=k,brown=n,buff=b,chocolate=h,green=r,orange=o,purple=u,white=w,yellow=y
Population: abundant=a,clustered=c,numerous=n,scattered=s,several=v,solitary=y
Habitat: grasses=g,leaves=l,meadows=m,paths=p,urban=u,waste=w,woods=d
class:poisonous=p, edible=e

* Summarize the dataset:(check the dimension of your data, statistical summary of all attributes, class distribution...)
* Prepare your data(check missing values, apply transformation if it's needed)
* Make some visualizations(both univariate and multivariate plots)
* Implement some models(more than three algorithms) and estimate their accuracy on unseen data. (Explain minutely the steps of models implementation)
* Plot the ROC curves of each model in one graph to resume all True Positive rates of all models.
* Conclude.

Don't forget to ensure good code quality(comment your code, respect indentation, make your code clear and coherent..)
